# Dog-Identification-App

## Project overview
In this project we develop an algorithm and create a webapp to detect if an image contains a dog or human.
A convolutional neural network (CNN) will classify the dog's breed or the resemplance of a human to a breed. The projects uses the stanford dogs dataset.

As part of this case I created a web app that allows users to upload their own image to classifie.
